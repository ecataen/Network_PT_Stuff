Internal/External Network PT Checklist (kinda high level view)

External
[+] Port Scans (all including TCP and UDP ports)
[+] Search for any know exploits on all open services
[+] If you see a web service port open, treat it like a web app attack surface.
  [-] See the flow of specific service and see if it can be manipulated
  [-] Search for any login page, file uploads, auth issues, any bypass, LFI/RFI etc.

Internal
[+] Start with traffic sniffing.
[+] Gather internal endpoints list, hunt their connections, see for their communications.
[+] See for ARP tables, map the host list
[+] Look for plaintext protocols like FTP, Telnet, HTTP, SMTP, SNMP etc.
[+] Search for SIP traffic, sniff voice traffic for potential creds communications
[+] Look for other VLANs, vlan tags and host connections/communications
[+] Look for DTP, STP CDP traffic and try to manipulate STP to get root election
[+] Execute port scans (all including TCP and UDP ports)
[+] Search for any know exploits on all open services
[+] If you see a web service port open, treat it like a web app attack surface.
  [-] See the flow of specific service and see if it can be manipulated
  [-] Search for any login page, file uploads, auth issues, any bypass, LFI/RFI etc.
[+] Start hunting for LM hashes
[+] Look for protocols like DNS, LDAP, Kerberos etc
[+] Start the hunt for AD Domain Controllers.
[+] Look for kerberoasting and potential golden/silver ticketing tactics
[+] Once inside a box
  [-] Look for creds and config files 
  [-] Look for internally running services, ’ps -aux’-ish
  [-] Look for cron jobs, hunt other user, executables, exposed root level files
  [-] Look for vertical priv esc, else try horizontal and repeat the above steps
  [-] Look for critical files (eg: ‘Secret.pdf’ etc.) to show business impact
  [-] Look for persistence ways, so when you come back tomorrow you can continue etc.
  [-] Start jumping into other boxes and other subnets etc etc

Important bit: GET a POC everytime you come across ’stuff’, go back home and create a CLEAR REPORT.

Note: Again, this is just a high level view. So please feel free to contribute. :)
